# Scratchpad

## 2026-02-10 - Iteration 1
- Objective: Build a mobile-first React exercise tracker per `specs/exercise-tracker/*` with pnpm + Vite + Vitest + Playwright.
- Current repository state: no app scaffold yet; only specs and orchestration files exist.
- Plan:
  - Create runtime tasks aligned to `specs/exercise-tracker/plan.md` steps to keep work atomic and track dependencies.
  - Complete exactly one atomic task now: Step 1 (project initialization and test foundations).
  - For Step 1, scaffold Vite React app (TypeScript), add Vitest + Testing Library setup, add Playwright mobile smoke test, and ensure scripts run.
  - Verify by running unit tests, Playwright smoke test, and production build before commit.
- Confidence: 92/100 on approach because plan already specifies incremental step ordering and initial baseline behavior.
