# Rough Idea

Create a React exercise tracker using `pnpm`, `Vite`, and `Vitest`.

Requirements:
- Mobile-optimized layout.
- Focus on tracking within an exercise session.
- Allow skipping an exercise.
- Track sets, reps, and duration for each exercise.
- Persist session data in local storage.
- Load exercise data from a JSON file.
- Exercises should match the list from the Knee pain plan (EPUB/PDF source).
