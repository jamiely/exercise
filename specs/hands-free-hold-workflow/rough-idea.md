# Rough Idea

1. When we start a new exercise that requires holding, have a start button. When the user presses it, start counting the hold down. Show tenths of seconds. Then, countdown a rest period. Make it configurable for each exercise, default to 30s for now. Then continue the countdown for the next rep. We want to be as hands free as possible. Add a pause button.

2. Don't show the `target:` and `active set:` text. Instead, infer this from the other visual indicators.

3. When a set is done, move to the next set automatically. Show a rest timer between sets. This is a separate configurable setting defaulted to 30s.
