# Planning Summary: Todo Execution

## Artifacts

- `specs/todo-execution/rough-idea.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/requirements.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/research/state-and-timer-risks.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/research/testing-matrix.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/design.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/plan.md`
- `specs/todo-execution/summary.md`

## Overview

This spec package converts `todo list.md` into a complete delivery blueprint with:

- clear requirements,
- risk-focused research,
- standalone design with acceptance criteria,
- and a phased implementation plan.

The package is structured to support incremental delivery of all backlog items while preserving timer correctness and UX reliability.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Review and approve `specs/todo-execution/requirements.md` and `specs/todo-execution/design.md`.
2. Execute `specs/todo-execution/plan.md` step-by-step.
3. For each implementation phase, add required unit + Playwright coverage and run full quality gates for code changes.
