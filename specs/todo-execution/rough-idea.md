# Rough Idea

Take the current backlog from `todo list.md` and convert it into a complete, execution-ready specification package under `specs/`.

Primary intent:

- Fix timer correctness and pause behavior regressions.
- Improve workout flow controls (explicit start, dismiss rest, restart set/exercise).
- Ensure any timed state always has a clear visible timer.
- Improve perceived UX quality with exercise transition animation.
- Align docs (`README.md`) with CI status and up-to-date product screenshots.

The package should support stepwise implementation while keeping test and coverage standards intact for production code changes.
